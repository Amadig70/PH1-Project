This project analyses the understanding of the market landscape needed to by Microsoft to start a new movie studio, which looks to secure a portion of the market that is already dominated by the existing movie produces and eventually become the leading studio. Exploratory analysis of the movies produced, the ratings, the genre the sales/revenue, the market capture among the existing movie producers and the average runtime of the movies being produced.

<h1 style="font-size: 18px;">Business Problem</h1>

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create. 

 <h1 style="font-size: 18px;">Understanding the data</h1>
 
The data is from IMDB Web site that provides information about multiple movies, films, and TV programs. This data has consistent updates and its reliable based on the background research I undertaken. This data will assist me in getting insights that will enable me advice Microsoft on what movies to start with when starting their new movie production. The data also speaks to movie length and sales made by movies and the respective producers who represent the market competition.

A combination of action, adventure and Sci-Fi perform better in revenue generation as compared to the other sets of diversifications of films. This is closely followed by a combination of action, adventure & comedy and at third place action, adventure & fantasy. With this trend it is ok to conclude that films with both action and adventure combined in one set does well in sales generation.

 When it comes to the production of the films, pure drama as a genre is the most produced amongst all genres followed by a combination of comedy & drama. At this point its easy to conclude that production has no impact on sales as many people buy a combination of action, adventure, and Sci-Fi as opposed to the most produced, drama.
